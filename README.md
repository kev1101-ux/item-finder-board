## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
   ```
3. **Install NPM packages:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. **Set up Firebase:**

   - Create a new Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - In your project settings, add a new web app and copy the `firebaseConfig` object.
   - Create a new file `src/lib/firebase.ts` and add your Firebase configuration like so:

   ```ts
   import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
   import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
   import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";

   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };

   const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   const db = getFirestore(app);
   const storage = getStorage(app);

   // Add your item management functions here...

   export { db, storage };
   ```

   - Make sure to enable Firestore and Storage in your Firebase project.
5. **Run the development server:**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the application on a local development server, typically `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

The application is configured to be deployed to any static hosting provider. You can build the application by running:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready files, which you can then deploy.
